NormalBall Class
-wrote display() using the correct RGB values as the ball in the game, and arc() for the quadrants
-wrote move() to increment the x and y coors, and the ySpeed to emulate gravity
Wrote setup() with dimensions of the display and ball that matched the game.
Wrote draw() with restrictions that respawn the ball if it goes out of boundary.
